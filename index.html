    <title>Looking for a lovely new flatmate! :)</title>

      <h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <p>
        We’re Jules and Lara, an international couple (Spanish, Canadian,
        Belgian) who have been living in Brussels for 7 years. Our ad is in
        English, mais nous parlons couramment le français.
      </p>
      <p>
        🧭 We’re looking for a new flatmate or flatmates to live with us in our
        bright, 2-bedroom flat situated near to the Palais de Justice. The room
        is 2.75 x​​​ 3.45 metres (9.5m2) and is available from the 1st of
        August, but we’re willing to wait until September for the right match!
      </p>
      <p>
        🚵 After 3.5 years, our current flatmate is embarking on a long-term
        bicycle trip and doesn’t know when they’ll be coming back to Brussels,
        so we’re looking for the next person or people to make a new home
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        🙋‍♂️ Jules loves to make things – from the dining table to the spice shelf,
        tinkering for bicycle adventures, helping friends fix their bikes and
        furniture, and converting what’s left in the fridge into a fantastic
        meal. 🙋‍♀️ Lara loves music (listening at home while cooking and doing
        emails, as much as going out until the sun is rising), spending time
        with friends, watching anime, and is currently working on getting back
        into regular bouldering and yoga. 🫶 We love watching films (we might watch 3 a week in the winter!), hosting
        long brunches and dinners, chatting with friends for hours about
        everything happening in life and the world, and (re)discovering all that
        Brussels has to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        🐶🐈 We pet-sit regularly (usually dogs, sometimes cats), so our home is the
        perfect place if you enjoy the occasional cuddle and play with a furry
        friend. Jules works from home full time and Lara works from home 2-3
        days a week, which allows us to take care of so many animal friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        😋 We’re vegetarians at home and so would prefer to live with
        someone/people who align with that lifestyle, but this is not at all a
        deal-breaker.
      </p>
      <p>🌈 We are an LGBTQIA+ household and 420+ friendly.</p>
      <p>
        ✨ Something important to note is that we don’t have a hired cleaner –
        we all share cleaning duties weekly, and keeping a tidy and clean space
        is important to us. This is to make sure that we can all use the spaces
        when we want to, and feel at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        📍 We’re located 15 minutes away from both Midi and Central train stations
        by foot, close to both Louise and Hôtel des Monnaies metro stations, and
        have a great variety of supermarkets and markets within walking
        distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        👋 We’re looking for someone who will want to make this space their home,
        share meals and conversations together spontaneously, will
        be down to bring a drink to watch the sunset, suggest activities, want to play games and
        watch films together, etc. If you’re into takeaway dinners and evenings
        behind a closed bedroom door, we probably aren’t the right match.
      </p>
      <p>
        🏡 The room is fully furnished (see photos below) – all you need to do is
        bring your sheets, towels and the items that make your spaces in and
        outside of the room feel like home. We also have a fully equipped
        kitchen and love to cook! Don’t hesitate to bring kitchen tools and
        gadgets to make all your favourite things.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rent, which includes home insurance, private insurance
        (responsabilité civile), internet, water, gas, and electricity bills is
        EUR 685 for one person and EUR 750 for a couple. Domiciliation is
        welcomed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for reading this far! If you’re interested, please write to
        <a href="mailto:larajun1986@gmail.com">larajun1986@gmail.com</a> and
        tell us about yourself and when you’d be available to move in.
